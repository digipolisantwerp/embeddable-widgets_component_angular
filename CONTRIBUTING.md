# Contribution Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

## I just have a question

You can launch a quick question on the [#acpaas-ui-ngx slack channel](https://digantcafe.slack.com/messages/CDF95H5B7). If you're not yet a member of our DigAnt CafÃ© slack community, you can easily [join here](https://digantcafe-slack.digipolis.be/).

For something that requires longer discussion it may be better to book an issue.

## How do I report bugs / ask features?

Please book a GitHub issue.

## What should I know to get started?
